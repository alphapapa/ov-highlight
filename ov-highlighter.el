;;; Commentary:
;; ov-highlighter provides a lightweight way to highlight text and put notes on
;; them using overlays that are locally stored.

;; There is a hydra menu to make accessing all the commands below convenient:
;; `ov-highlighter/body'. I suggest you bind it to a key like H-h.

;; You can select text, and run these commands to add highlighting to it:
;; `ov-highlight' will prompt you for a color, and highlight with it.
;; These convenience functions skip the color prompt.
;; `ov-highlight-yellow'
;; `ov-highlight-blue'
;; `ov-highlight-green'
;; `ov-highlight-pink'

;; `ov-highlight-note' will prompt you for a color, highlight the text and add a
;; Note to it as a tooltip. You can edit a note with `ov-highlight-note-edit'.

;; You can list all the highlights with `ov-highlight-list' in a buffer that
;; you can easily navigate to each one from.

;; You can clear a single highlight under the cursor with `ov-highlight-clear'.
;; Remove all the highlights with `ov-highlight-clear-all'.

;; ov-highlighter uses a local save-buffer-hook to update the data when you
;; save the buffer. It also uses local file variables to load the highlights
;; when you open the file.

;; Known issues: You cannot cut and paste these highlights. Fixing this would
;; involve changing the kill and yank functions to capture overlays in the kill
;; region, and remake them in the yanked region.
